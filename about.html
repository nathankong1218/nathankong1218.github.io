            <p style="font-family: American Typewriter"> <strong> This page contains information about me. My name is Nathan Kong and I am from Cranston, Rhode Island. I am a student majoring into <br>
    computer science (BS) at URI. Some of my hobbies includes playing video games such as League of Legends, and playing lacrosse. When I grow <br>
    up, I hope to become a software developer and hopefully own a house in California. I am a huge star wars fan and my favorite football team <br> 
     is the New Orlean Saints. <br>
                <br>
When I am older, I hope I can become a software developer or database administator. I really enjoy computer science at the moment because <br>
 it offers a new way of creating things. That is the main reason why I chose to major in computer science because it offer innovation of making <br>
 new technology that can be use by many.
