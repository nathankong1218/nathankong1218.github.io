   <p> This page contains information about me. My name is Nathan Kong and I am from Cranston, Rhode Island. I am a student majoring in <br>
    computer science (BS) at URI. Some of my hobbies includes playing video game such as League of Legends, and playing lacrosse. When I grow <br>
    up, I hope to become a software developer and hopefully own a house in California. I am a huge star wars fan and my favorite football team <br> 
     is the New Orlean Saints.
