<h1> Nathan's Final Project </h1>
   <p style="font-family: Arial;"> This page contain information on my final project, which I created with my partner Nick Rizzo. The game we had chosen to do was the game called Jeopardy, which is similar to the quiz game we had done before in Khan.  
   The objective of the game is to select a question catagory and select the correct answer to that question. Each question is weighted differently and if you get the correct answer you win that amount you selected. However, if you lose, you also lose that amount you selected and it can get to a negative score.
   Hope you have fun and win that money ! Back to <a href="index.html"> home page </a> </p>
