  <h1> Welcome to Nathan's Programming Portfolio </h1>
   <p><font face="Arial"> Hello, my name is Nathan Kong. This website is my online programming portfolio, which I will use to display my works that I have done in my CSC class. I wrote this website using the HTML language. Above, I have listed tabs, which can be use 
    to navigate my works. The javascript tab above has javacripts that I have written. The app tab contains apps that I have written 
    for mobile phones. Lastly, the about me tab contains a profile of about me.  <br>   
    
       Changes have been made to this website by using CSS. A seperate CSS sheet had been used. Some changes includes a change to the background
       color, change in text font, a new banner, and alignment of the tabs. Future changes will continue to be made as time goes on.
